NAME
    Web::Library::BackboneJS - Distribution wrapper around Backbone.js

SYNOPSIS
        my $library_manager = Web::Library->instance;
        $library_manager->mount_library({ name => 'BackboneJS' });

DESCRIPTION
    This is a distribution wrapper around Backbone.js. It enables you to
    include the client-side library in multiple Web application projects
    with very little effort. See Web::Library for the general concept and
    how to use it with Catalyst.

    Backbone needs Underscore.js, so Web::Library::UnderscoreJS is listed as
    a dependency.

    files are listed. Files marked with an asterisk are included in that
    versions' asset list - see Web::Library's "css_link_tags_for()" and
    "script_tags_for()" methods for an explanation of the concept.
